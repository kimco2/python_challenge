Hello

This repository is for the homework challenge 3 on python.  

It contains two folders:
1 - PyBank
2 - PyPoll

Inside each folder there is:
 - A file called main.py which contains the python code.
 - An additional folder called 'analysis' which contains the output text file from when the code has been run (output.txt).

Thanks
Kim
