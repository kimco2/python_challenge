Hello

This repository is for the homework challenge 3 on python.  

This folder has two main directories:
1 - PyBank
2 - PyPoll

Inside each there is a file called main.py which contains the python code.

The output from when the code has been run can be found in the analysis folder, in the file called 'output.txt'.

Thanks
Kim
